So we do have folks that haven't come to the vein, but have had either siblings or have some tie to Mr. McBain or just ties to the community. Um, one of the things that we wanted to do was to make sure that we have the history of how this school started, and it had to start out of the schools before McBain was actually even built. So the Douglas and the a CT, um, ideas came about as a result of that. But as you look around the room, this is our, our designated area for now of all of the memorabilia of the classes of Ma Bain High School.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

One of the things I wanted our children to do was to understand the history behind this school, and this is about a year and a half of work where the different classes have come in and gotten samples for this room. So when the kids come through, they can look at the rich legacy of Amma Bain High School and understand that, um, so high schools, the years, the graduating classes have samples from their high school years. And I'm sure that today we'll talk about some of those experiences that you bring to the documentary as well. So you are making history today, and thank you. You, you're making history today. We will. Um, and we're rolling. So whenever you want to start. Okay. We will, um, have a copy of the tape for you at the end of March. Once we edit out, what we'll do is we're filming today and there's segments that we'll keep in segments because we are interviewing so many different people. Your perspective is what we're looking for. So if I don't get to all the questions, don't worry about it. If I only get to a few, I just wanna know what your experiences were. Okay. We'll start on this end and then get around to Mr. Hill and just, just ask you to tell us a little bit about you and who you are. Okay. We'll start with you.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

If it's nighttime, you cannot expect those kids, you cannot say harsh words to 'em, because the kids run back to their parents and it is a different thing altogether.
