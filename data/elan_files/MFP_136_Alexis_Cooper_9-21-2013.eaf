Do you know if there's a reason why, like where, what was the gap that you feel you started falling behind or what was the reason for it? Um, I think it like when, when like I used to like, like I used to have like doctor appointment in the morning time and I used to have reading class, but I, I had wanted to go to school then I didn't wanna go to the doctor because I, I already knew that I was gonna be behind on something and then I had to go to school too the next day and to remake up my work and I really didn't understand what went on like in a book or something.

Okay, so you had to go every and then that made you miss reading? Yeah. Okay. So then is, and that started when like, in my fifth grade and sixth grade year. And that made you miss the readings? Yes. And that in turn brought you behind. So how much of class were you missing when you left? Like about 20. About 20 minutes. Okay. So you were doing 20 minutes of reading.

So no one. So that opportunity wasn't really given to you. Okay. So then did you go home and try to make up for it? Like do you have those resources at home or could you take that book at home or make up for it? Yes, I took the book home, then I read story and then I came back and I asked my teacher some questions that I didn't understand about the book. And what did you find that helpful? Yes. But then, so where did you find that you were falling behind? Like, um, like our worksheets that we had did in class and I, and I took them home and some of the questions that I didn't understand, I had to take the paper back and ask them so I can understand the questions. Okay. And then how are you doing with math and science? I'm doing good with math and science. And what about writing? I'm good. Okay.

Has anyone discouraged you from attending college? No. No? Okay. That's good to hear. Um, so tell me a little bit about your classroom. What are, what is the student population like? Um, like their kind of races, like the race, um, and then your teachers. Um, my class is not racist because it is only like 11 students in my classroom. And there's only 11 students in your classroom? Yes, but it is, we got, it's the eighth grade we split up. It's not that many eighth graders at my school because some of 'em had transferred last year. Why? Um, because some parents, they think the school is getting a band influenced on their children. Why? Because um, like they used like at the end of the school year they said that they gonna do something to the teachers and stuff and they don't want their child to get hurt.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

So there's different stuff going on over there? Pretty much. But it's just specifically different people but it's the same issue. Do your teachers know about this? Some teachers do, but some teachers don't like deal with it. How, in what ways do they deal or not deal with it? 'cause some teacher they say like if they bring it into their classroom, they gonna automatically call the principal and tell the principal, tell the principal and the principal call their parents.
