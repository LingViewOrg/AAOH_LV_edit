They kind of told us what was going on out in the field and stuff, you know. And after we was there for a while and got our jungle fatigues and jungle boots and all that kind of good stuff. And our weapon, which I had a M 16, um, they flew us out in the field and we joined another company.

Um, a couple times, well, I'm speak one time that we got in combat and we, uh, we had a company, we had a squad to go out on an ambush. I get a little emotional when I tell this, but I can make it through it. Um, it was like a squad of about 12 people had went out. They send somebody that way, that way, you know, the patrol while the company is set up to try to ease out and see whether there's any enemy movement out there. But anyway, before this, uh, squad got back, they got ambush. So they killed all of them.

The enemy knows the, the closer they are to us, the safer they are from that artillery. So when things finally cooled down, um, one guy, American, our troops, he was going out just to be a li listening post at the, at the, at the edge of the wood line. 'cause we had our dead troops there. But then he got ambushed. So we start firing our guns and throwing grenades until finally killed him. Um, so when it, it finally cooled down that they was not firing back at us, and we assumed that either they were gone or they were dead the enemy.

Another incident is somebody killed a bunch of'em. There's two types of people you fight. You fight the vecon, which can use booby traps and all that kind of stuff. We didn't have to worry about booby traps, punchy bits. And, uh, north Vietnamese regiments. Now, I was in the jungle. We fought the regular soldiers.
