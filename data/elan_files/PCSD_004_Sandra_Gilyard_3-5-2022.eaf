Uh, we were bused and a few whites rode the bus. And one day my aunt was a bus driver, my Aunt Lillian, and she was a bus driver. And one day we got on the bus and she said, you can't have, you all can't sit in these first five seats. And I said, huh. This is my aunt never said. She said, no, say, I was told that the white kids had to sit up here and you all sit to the back. And, and of course I said, I don't, I don't agree with that. I say, this is, is over.

And he told me, in no uncertain tone, you just sit down and shut up. Well, the next day I get to Black South, they called me in the office saying, I cursed him out, used profanity. Mind you.
