Gosh, that's wonderful. Now, during that time, I, I did some, I championed some things. I, um, was appointed by Governor Laton Charles to the Healthy Kids Program. It, it still, I, they, I don't know. I don't think it's Healthy Kids way anymore. It is something else. I was appointed, uh, to the board of directors.

We have, uh, very, very few that may be in a larger, under healthy kids at the school system, but we do have health, you know? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

Now, that was the myth that was going on at that time, particularly in New York and Harlem. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. But it was going around, you know, everywhere. And people just weren't interested in trying to see whether that was true or not. But this guy did. And, and Harlem, and found out that those kids excelled.

It started out as being new teachers, but we wanted, I wanted it to, uh, be for veteran teachers too, but I felt like the, uh, new teachers needed it most. So we kind of geared it toward that because, uh, you know, they needed it most. So. But it's, it's a very good program. I'm proud of that. What else? &lt;laugh&gt; trying to find. Oh, uniforms.

Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. The, the, uh, peer driven fashion shows where the girls showing too much skin. The boys are coming down with that. And it, it is just a shame.

				<ANNOTATION_VALUE>Uhhuh, &lt;affirmative&gt; we're still uniforms. We made a policy of it. And, and, uh, so we had that policy. Now, the first, uh, school district in the state of Florida to do that was Polk County. That was in the early nineties. Some, somewhere back then. Uh, and they were challenged. They were sued because a lot of the parents did not want the children to wear uniforms. And, uh, so they sued the par, they got together and they sued the school board. Well, the judge upheld for the school board because they said that the school board have the right to, uh, determine what they think is best for their school districts. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

I was, uh, presiding over all of the 67 counties in the state of Florida. Oh, God. So I did that. That's a year. You do that for a year.

When, uh, she, she worked in the tobacco fields and she was a very proud woman. She, um, had very little education, but, uh, she was able to, uh, get along with young people or anybody. They loved her. They called her mama sis, &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;. And she just believed, and when people come, they could be passing by, Hey, mama. Si. Hey, come on in and have something to eat. She wanna feed everybody &lt;laugh&gt;. But, uh, but, uh, and she was really, I learned a lot from her too, how to be, uh, gracious and how to have pride in what you had. And, and she liked to dress and wear her hats to church and all this kind of stuff. She was a very proud woman. But she died. She had a heart attack. She went to one of her prince's funeral. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, uh, she had a heart attack the very day of the after, right after she came back from the funeral, died right there. Oh,</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So that's the way I, I see that. But I'm supportive of him. I, I could not, I was so happy to see him being the first black, even though he's, uh, uh, uh, you know, he's got he mixed parentage and all that. It, it, it's okay. That, that's fine.

But, uh, so that, you know, so that's how that goes. But I am proud of him, and hopefully he will, um, overcome this. But it's hard because he's not used to having people, you know, in a position like the Congress is. And they're all against him, and they're expecting him to do miracles that nobody did. They expect him to walk on water without insulting the environmentalists. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

Because nine times outta 10, what it causes kids to do is when they start overburdening them, them with all that stuff, they drop out mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And then they wonder why the dropout rate is so high. It's high because you're not gearing it toward what they need. We need vocation. 'cause a lot of kids are not going to go to college.

It's up to these parents to get these kids ready to go to school. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. They need to be ready when they come to us, because when they're not, the teachers have to focus on those few who are disturbed mentally by no fault of their own.
