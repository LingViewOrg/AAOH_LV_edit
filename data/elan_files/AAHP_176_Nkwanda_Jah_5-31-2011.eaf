And then you gotta know where that came from and the history of that, and, you know, really understand. I mean, I didn't even know the King James version was only done in the, in the 17 hundreds. I thought King James version came all the way back from three a, you know, ad or something. I didn't even know, you know? And so many things that you don't know, you know, and you don't look at in terms of time and, and, and re reality, you know, we are fed these fairytales and, you know, and this church does not do that.

He get caught up and he curse, you know, I mean, it's nothing for him to try to do some Stevie Wonder or some Marvin Gaye from his pulpit, you know, or to move the pulpit so that the young people can get up and do hip hop or whatever they're doing in the church. You know? I mean, those are kinds of things. Uh, I don't know if you know about Kwana, but it's a seven day, uh, celebration. And for most of the com, most of African Americans do it. That last week of dec from December Christmas day through January 1st at this church, we do Kwanza all year round.

You know, I think that, um, that we are all children of God, uh, that there have been prophets like Jesus, Malcolm Martin, Sojourner Gandhi, and others that have given their lives. They knew that somebody would kill him. They knew it, but they kept on going, you know? And if, if, and and I tell people all the time, I love Jesus more than most Christians do. I respect the work that he did. I want to do, and I try to do the work that Jesus did. And if all Christians would just do the work that he did, and not just try to give accolades and jump up and down and, you know, like to do for Martin, give all of these plaques and everything out.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>
