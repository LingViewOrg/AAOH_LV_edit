And I couldn't let it just sit there because I'm on these people computer and they would know what I'm doing. So when the supervisor at the time, which was my mom come by, she was like, what's wrong? Why are you sitting up here crying? I was like, ain't no one working. My fingers are hurt. I can't cut this fish this fast. And she was like, they, they done block the fish. Now you take that, for example, if they had a union there, oh my gosh, it was been, it probably would've been some firing going on, but because of no union, there was nothing dead about it.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

People just make excuses. And she was, she made something that made a lot of sense. She said something to me, she was like, we could have, we could go down there and we could rent out a building and we could tell them to come eat with us and drink free with us so we could talk to them. And she said, you wouldn't believe it, but probably half of that company inside of there, those people will be there. But if you tell them just to come up here, or if we go out there and stand on the side of the road like we did last year, and you know, with our signs and stuff, we got people talking trash to us and they're not going to do that.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

People as people here want, need to, want to do that, but they want, they just want what's given to 'em. And that's all you know, you really, and it's sad when you look at it because we as a people, you think about working in a catfish place and I have worked there, so I know you can't send your kids off to college with that.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

And people here are just looking at the fact of, I'm just getting paycheck. Instead of looking at, there could be something better about this job. We can have better benefits. Our kids can, you know, get sick. It's, it's getting cold. A lot of people here don't have insurance. A lot of kids don't have insurance. And if you go to the clinic, you will see this people trying to come up with money so that kids could go.

When you think about it, the poor people, the recession's kind of good on us because, um, you have more programs coming in now. Like for example, the STEP program, it's a government program, but it helps you get a job. You got a lot of parents out there that cannot get a job. I don't care how hard you try, you can go put an application in every week, every week, call these people every week and they will not call you.
