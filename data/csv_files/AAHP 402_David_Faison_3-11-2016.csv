G: 	 So I’m Katie Gresham here with David Faison on March 11th at Silver Springs.,,,,,,,
G: 	 So; I’m just going to ask you first how did you become a boat driver here at Silver Springs?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; I had a brother here he came here in 56 me in 57 and we’re about the two oldest things here right now.,1*,,,,,,
F:	And when I come uh uh I like what I seen.,,,,,,,
"F:	 I was training; I was trained, and I begin to uh take people out and I made everybody so happy so I enjoyed doing what I was doing; that’s the reason for me putting as many years into this place as I have; cause I was enjoying what I was doing.",,,,,,,
F:	 That’s making somebody happy.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; were you hired by Rayan Davidson originally?,,,,,,,
F:	 Sorry?,,,,,,,
G:	 Rayan Davidson?,,,,,,,
G:	 The people who owned it?,,,,,,,
F: 	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F: 	 Yeah they hired me right there.,,,,,,,
F: 	 First one you’re looking at is Corey; next one in the middle is old-man Dave they was piloting ships together.,,1,,,,,
F: 	 And then the one out there about in the far left that was his son; Buckley; those were the guys that hired me back; 1957.,,,,,,,
G:	 Wow!,,,,,,,
G:	 So how- your brother worked here a year before you did?,,,,,,,
F: 	 Yeah he come here in 56 me in 57.,,,,,,,
F: 	 We are the two oldest things here right now.,1*,,,,,,
G: 	 So how were you treated as a boat driver?,,,,,,,
F:	 Oh; I loved doing what I was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 I loved it because I made a lot of people happy.,,1*,,,,,
F:	 We would go down there back in the day because there was a whole lot more to see then than what we are seeing today.,,,,,,,
G: 	 Um-hm; what was different?,,,,,,,
F:	 We would; well; we had more fish.,,,,,,,
F:	 I remember a time I could take that boat I could spin it ‘round I don’t care where in that river and I’d have that glass just full of blue-gill and bream as you could see.,,,,,,,
G: 	 So what happened to the fish?,,,,,,,
F:	 They began to dribble away.,,,,,,,
"F:	 When they started with the state barge canal; they say they was gonna finish it I don’t think they are, they ain’t finished it so far; I doubt that they- ",,,,,,,
F:	 But anyway; that’s cause it was wars.,,,,,,,
"F:	 In those days it was just two things going; Silver Springs, Cypress Gardens; those were the two main attractions back in the days.",,,,1,,,
G:	 So; would people come to Florida and come to both things?,,,,,,,
F: 	 No.,,,,,,,
G:	 Why not?,,,,,,,
F:	 I’ve done all of mine right here.,,,,,,,
F:	 Right up and down that river right there.,,,,,,,
F:	 The head water of the Silver river; that’s the beginning of it; I’d bring you down.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s where all my training; that’s where I got it right there.,,,,,,,
G: 	 How were you trained as a boat driver?,,,,,,,
G: 	 What was the training?,,,,,,,
F:	 The training; oh the change?,,,,,,,
G:	 The training on how you became a boat driver.,,,,,,,
F:	 Oh; I guess like doing what I was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 All we done was just ride with another captain.,,,,,0,,
F:	 And see what he does and you take it from there.,,,,,,,
F:	 Sometimes you do good; sometimes better than one you rode with.,,,,,,,
F:	 In my case it happened many times.,,,,,,,
G:	 So when Silver Springs was segregated you drove white and black people in the boats?,,,,,,,
F: 	 Absolutely; absolutely-- ,,,,,,,
G:	 Interesting--,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; was there ever any backlash because you were a black boat driver?,,,,,,,
F:	 Not necessarily; no.,,,,,,,
F:	 We had both; we had black captains and white captains also.,,,,,,,
G:	 I didn’t know there was white captains--,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
G:	 I thought they were always black captains.,,,,,,,
G:	 Interesting.,,,,,,,
F:	 We had a few.,,,,,,,
F:	 We had some here.,,,,,,,
F:	 Up there’s a picture of some of us you might wanna look at that; too; before you walk out of here.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah; I will.,,,,,,,
F:	 I don’t know; but that one was done back in 72.,,,,,,,
F:	 A lot of them have already gone back in that day.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; that’s what it was.,,,,,,,
F:	  Wasn’t nothing but a string of us; Twenty-some of us.,,,,,,,
G:	 Wow!,,,,,,,
G:	 How many boats were there?,,,,,,,
F:	 Twenty-Five.,,,,,,,
F:	 Look in front of ya.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s what we were running.,,,,,,,
G:	 And they were all full; everyday?,,,,,,,
"F:	  Always glass-bottom, yeah; we had a jumbo boat; which was a much larger boat.",,,,,,,
F:	 I don’t think he’s on- in this.,,,,,,,
"F:	I think that uh, mostly somewhere; I look at a picture we had made up there- on there, somewhere’s the captain it was in 72; I wanna say.",,,,,,,
F:	 It’s up there anyway; you take a look at it.,,,,,,,
F:	 But that’s what we done.,,1,,,,,
F:	 We was here back in the day; and that’s what we used to do.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; what- did Paradise Park opening affect your job at all?,,,,,,,
F:	 No.,,,,,,,
F:	 Paradise was here when I come here.,,,,,,,
G:	 Oh; Paradise was here- Oh; right!,,,,,,,
G:	 You’re right.,,,,,,,
G:	 So wdas it different; then; when you had to go over there or--?,,,,,,,
F:	 A lot of times; we go there all the time anyway.,,,,,,,
F:	 A lot of the time they would call; they had one or two boats there.,,,,,,,
F:	 Sometimes the crowd got larger.,,,,,,,
F:	 If it did they’d just call the phone; the PD bell rang ; whoever was workin’ the front-- Alright guys; “We need one to PD Anybody wanna go volunteer or I’m gonna draft somebody?”,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s the way we acted.,,,,,,,
F:	 We’d go down there—I enjoyed it all.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; were you born here; in Ocala?,,,,,,,
F:	 Not in Ocala.,,,,,,,
F:	 Fort McCoy.,,,,,,,
G:	 Fort McCoy?,,,,,,,
G:	 When were you born?,,,,,,,
F:	 19. Fort McCoy ; I was born 19…,,,,,,,
F:	 Can’t even think of my birthday.,,,,,,,
F:	 32.,,,,,,,
G:	 1932?,,,,,,,
G:	 What did your parents do?,,,,,,,
F:	 They did a little of everything just here and there. Different time to what it is today. ,,,,,,,
"F:	 I lost my father at an early age; too; at forty-five years. When I got there, I thought about it; Lord have mercy. ",,,,,,,
F:	  He was a young guy; but technology just wasn’t where it was that day; like it is today.,,,,,,,
F:	 So many problems people had then; knock it out like nothing. ,,,,,,,
F:	 Then he just wasn’t there.,,,,,,,
G:	 How did having Paradise Park here change Silver Springs as a whole?,,,,,,,
F:	 How did what now?,,,,,,,
G:	 Having Paradise Park—Did it change Silver Springs; do you think?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 This come up during segregation days.,,,,,,,
F:	 And this is the purpose of all what you’re seeing in here right now.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yes; there was a change.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; it was change.,,,,,,,
F:	 I never felt too much of a bite from it; cause I enjoyed doing what I was doin’.,,,,,,,
F:	 And most people that I rode—that’s what made me; a sort of interesting thing.,,,,,,,
F:	 Because you made a lot of peoples happy and that was my goal; to make somebody happy.,,1*,,,,,
F:	 I’m not here to offend anybody; I’m here to try and make them happy.,,,,,,,
F:	 And that’s what I done.,,,,,0,,
F:	 And; that’s the purpose of me putting in the time that I did.,,,,,,,
G:	 Make people happy.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; makin’ people happy; that’s the bottom line.,,1*,,,,,
F:	 But it was something out there to make them happy; back in those days.,,,,,,,
F:	 We would go back in there; I could take it and spin that boat around; I don’t care where in that river and I’d have that boat-  a glass full of fish; anywhere in the river.,,,,,,,
F:	 We’d feed them bread back in the day.,,,,,,,
F:	 So; it made a few changes in the feeding system; things like that.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; still; fun place to work.,,,,,,,
G:	 How- How have you seen Silver Springs change over the years?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; attendance has dropped.,,,,,,,
F:	  And; I’m gonna say this to ya.,,,,,,,
F:	 The state is there.,,,,,,,
F:	 When I was here; under those three guys—those are the ones that hired me on the wall.,,,,,,,
F:	 It was a theme park.,,,,,,,
F:	 All right?,,,,,,,
F:	 The state come in and changed it to be a state park.,,,,,,,
F:	 A lot of things we could do when it was a theme park; state didn’t want it to be that way.,,,,,,,
F:	 And that’s what’s making it slightly changed.,,,,,,,
G:	 And that’s why you think people don’t come as much?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yes.,,,,,,,
F:	 That hurt the attendance; definitely.,,,,,,,
G:	 Interesting.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; with Paradise Park—what kind of events would go on there?,,,,,,,
G:	 Did you get to participate in any of them?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 We done some of everything.,,,,,,,
F:	 Sometime we would go down there—we’d ride on Sundays.,,,,,,,
F:	 Sometime; we would go down; that’s where we used to turn around—at Paradise Park.,,,,,,,
G:	 Oh; okay!,,,,,,,
F:	 And; we’d go down there and sometimes they’d have fifteen to twenty converts; baptizing right in the Silver River.,,,,,,,
F:	 And we would go down there and there were boatloads of tourists; from here; we’d go around and spin the boat around.,,,,,,,
F:	 “Hold it right there; brother.,,,,,,,
F:	 What’s going on?”,,,,,,,
F:	   “A baptism is goin’ on over there.”,,,,,,,
F:	  And a lot of time I could see them going home when the baptism was over.,,,,,,,
F:	  Turn around; bring em back up the river.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s what we used to do.,,,,,,,
F:	 Fun place to work.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 What about all of the models; and the Miss Paradise Park competitions?,,,,,,,
G:	 Were those fun; too?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; no and yes.,,,,,,,
F:	  There’s a guy up there and he use to do all the filming for advertising for Silver Springs.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s Bruce Moller---he’s on that—the little short guy over there.,,,,,,,
F:	 He’s good at what he was doing; lots of these old cameras and things you see up there?,,,,,,,
F:	 He was good at that.,,,,,,,
F:	 And; that’s what he would do.,,,,,,,
F:	 And; he would stop up in the middle of the river and the trip was a forty-five minute ride.,,,,,,,
F:	For the glass-bottom boat,,,,,,,
F:	 They had the general crew would take you on down there; it was stay down there for about an hour or better; but it went much further down the river; five miles.,,,,,,,
F:	 Man; when you when see him coming; he’d wave his hand out like that.,,,,,,,
F:	 When he do that he’d want to stop and make some pictures where you was at that particular time.,,,,,,,
F:	 And we’d just stop the boat and he’d tell us what he want done and “Spin us around; raise ya windows; everybody hang on; feed the fish!”,,,,,,,
F:	  Okay; he’d get a shot of that.,,,,,,,
F:	 Then; he’s spinning around—couple of three positions that he would have you in.,,,,,,,
F:	 It wasn’t bad.,,,,,,,
F:	 I like doing what I was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 So; I done what he said.,,,,,,,
F:	 So; I enjoyed doing what I was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 So; the same way…,,,,,,,
G:	 He was enjoying what he was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 He did a good job at it.,,,,,,,
F:	 He made good shots; yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah; it was.,,,,,,,
G:	 I’ve seen lots of his pictures.,,,,,,,
G:	 They’re great.,,,,,,,
F:	 He’s good; ain’t no question about it.,,,1,,,,
F:	 Just to get by there.,,,,,,,
F:	 There or four months ago.,,,,,,,
G:	 I know.,,,,,,,
G:	 Before the book was released?,,,,,,,
F:	 Um-hm.,,,,,,,
G:	 Let’s see… What else was I gonna ask you?,,,,,,,
F:	 Just dig up something; I’m gonna give you answers for it.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
G:	 Were you affected at all by the Civil Rights Movement going on in the South as a whole; or…?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; yeah; I was aware of that cause I was in the middle of some of it; anyways.,,,,,,,
G:	 Oh; you were?,,,,,,,
G:	 We’ll now you gotta tell me about that.,,,,,,,
F:	  Yeah!,,,,,,,
G:	 What were you in the middle of?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; that’s what was goin’ on.,,,,,,,
F:	 I was just into it because it was interesting to me; you know?,,,,,,,
F:	  The way the thing was going; it wasn’t exactly right the way it was going for the get-go.,,,,,,,
F:	 And; that’s why I was right in the middle of it.,,,,,,,
F:	 I stayed right in the middle of it.,,,,,,,
G:	 Was working as a boat driver one of the better jobs for---?,,,,,,,
F:	 No; but I was happy with what I was doin’ here simply because what I done; I made people happy with what I was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 If I made them happy; then there was no reason for me not to be happy.,,,,,,,
G:	 Right.,,,,,,,
G:	 Had you worked other jobs before you were a boat driver?,,,,,,,
"F:	 Yeah; I used to---I come up on a farm. Farm my own self, paid one now; I did. ",,,,,,,
F:	  After I got here I got to busy here. ,,,,,,,
F:	 I just kind of let it fade away; that’s what it was.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; it was good!,,,,,,,
G:	 It was good?,,,,,,,
G:	 That’s great!,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; is there anything that you can tell me that you haven’t told other people?,,,,,,,
G:	 Because; I know you’ve been interviewed lots of times for the Ocala Star Banner and for the other books… Is there anything---?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; if a whole lot--- It may not come to my remembrance right now; but so much I done.,,,,,,,
F:	 And man; I could just about. Should’ve written a book about it anyway ,,,,,,,
F:	 I’ve seen it all and I’ve done it all.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
F:	 And; the bottom line was; what I done is that I make people happy with what I was doing.,,,,,,,
F:	 So it wasn’t no  one way or the other.,,,1,,,,
F:	 You know?,,,,,,,
F:	 People are people; I don’t care where you go.,,,,,,,
F:	 And I had some mighty good people there.,,,,,,,
G:	 Um-hm.,,,,,,,
G:	 Did you ever get to drive any of the celebrities that came to visit?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yup.,,,,,,,
G:	 Who did you drive?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 No; no.,,,,,,,
F:	 I just put them on my boat and take them down the river and show em… that happens all the time!,,,,,,,
F:	 So they come to respect me.,,,,,,,
G:	 That’s cool!,,,,,,,
F:	  And take them down the river.,,,,,,,
F:	  We done what we done all down to the end.,,,,,0,,
G:	 Okay!,,,,,,,
G:	 What about all the movies?,,,,,,,
G:	 What were- what was that like; when they were filming movies here?,,,,,,,
F:	 Oh.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s here on the wall.,,,,,,,
F:	 Just about everything you see up there--you see this was here; Johnny Weissmuller?,,,,,,,
G:	 Um-hm.,,,,,,,
F:	 That was one of the older movies.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; I can barely remember him.,,,,,,,
F:	 But just about everything else you see along there… All of that I can just about walk you through it; every bit of it.,,,,,,,
G:	 Wow!,,,,,,,
F:	 See this guy here?,,,,,,,
F:	 Rick O’Bryan? That’s my old buddy anyway. ,,,,,,,
G:	 Um-hm.,,,,,,,
"F:	  The Creature right there, him.  His mother was in here.",,,,,,,
F:	  I don’t know; three months ago?,,,,,,,
F:	 She say; “That’s my son!”,,,,,,,
F:	 And I said well; yeah; me and him done been in to something; I can tell you--- ,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah; wow!,,,,,,,
F:	 Oh; it’s been a fun place; no question---That’s a good guy up there; he’s done a lot of good.,1*,,,,,,
F:	 Lloyd Bridges---,,,,,,,
G:	 Lloyd Bridges?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; he was good.,,,,,,,
F:	 He was good.,,,,,,,
F:	 All of those guys were good.,,,,,,,
F:	 And the story goes on and on…,,,,,,,
G:	 It’s still going isn’t it?,,,,,,,
F:	 Still goes on.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
F:	 We don’t have nothing like the attendance that we used to have here.,,,1,,,,
G:	 Right.,,,,,,,
F:	 We all look out there.,,,,,,,
F:           Where all that grass done grew up there? ,,,,,,,
F:	 That used to be nothing but a big sand beach.,,,,,,,
G:	 Wow; I did not know that.,,,,,,,
F:	 Oh; yeah!,,,,,,,
F:	 All back in there.,,,,,,,
F:	 All of that was a big sand beach.,,,,,,,
F:	 Go in and take your dip in seventy-two degree water; come out lay in the sun and get your suntan.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s what it was all about back in the day.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
G:	 And; then; there was the separate beach over at Paradise Park that that all the African Americans---,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; that’s farther down.,,,,,,,
F:	 To get there.,,,,,,,
F:	 Ya’ll didn’t get there.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 Can you get to it today?,,,,,,,
F:	 You can but it’s done grew up; you wouldn’t know it.,,,,,1,,
G:	 Oh; okay.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s what I’m saying; there’s a road that go there.,,,,,,,
F:	 You come in on forty.,,,,,,,
F:	 You just shift over on Baseline.,,,,,,,
F:	 And; you’ll see the big road there going east.,,,,,,,
F:	 You just drive right down and it will take you right on down to Ole’ PD; or Paradise Park.,,,,,,,
F:	 I done went through it with  Well; they were just taking riders through it on the old buggy.,,,,,1,,
F:	 We done been all the way through there.,,,,,1,1,
G:	 Wow.,,,,,,,
G:	 Do any of the boats go by there now?,,,,,,,
F:	 No; no boats there at all.,,,,,,,
F:	 You wouldn’t even know it.,,,,,,,
G:	 You wouldn’t even know.,,,,,,,
F:	 This river; they cut a canal through there  And that’s where it would come out.,,,,,,,
G:	 Okay; for the canal?,,,,,,,
G:	 Okay.,,,,,,,
F:	 Right there down on PD; Paradise Park.,,,,,,,
F:	 I had to give one young guy—He come here; he wanted to make some pictures and he needed instruction.,,,,,,,
F:	 And I asked him; “Where you were going?”,,,,,,,
F:	  He said; “Oh; Paradise Park.”,,,,,,,
F:	  Then I just lay out; coming back the way it was.,,,,,,,
F:	 Now he said; “Yeah; I know where you were.”,,,,,,,
F:	  I say; “You remember that big rock set way out there?”,,,,,,,
F:	 He said; “Yeah.”,,,,,,,
F:	  I said; “Well if you get there you’re in trouble cause a big rock down in your path and everything; so”.,,,,,,,
F:	  He understood.,,,,,,,
F:	  Keep on askin.,,,,,,,
F:	 I don’t know; I’m going to give you answers; whatever you got there.,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
G:	 I’m trying to think of more things to ask.,,,,,,,
G:	 I think I’ve ask a lot of my questions already.,,,,,,,
G:	 Well; what happened when Paradise Park closed?,,,,,,,
F:	 They just shut it down.,,,,,,,
G:	 They just shut it down?,,,,,,,
F:	 Shut it down.,,,,,,,
F:	 That was a beautiful place!,,,,,,,
F:	 See all those pictures to your left?,,,,,,,
G:	 Yeah; they’re gorgeous!,,,,,,,
G:	 That's what it- ,,,,,,,
G:	  So what happened to the structures that were there? Did they- ,,,,,,,
F:	 All that; they just ripped down.,,,,,,,
G:	 They just teared it all down?,,,,,,,
F:	 Tore it down; .,,,,,,,
F:	 Used to have the same thing that this guy here;  that you’re lookin’ at up in there.,,,,,,,
G:	 Um-hm.,,,,,,,
G:	 Did he---?,,,,,,,
F:	 Okay.,,,,,,,
F:	 He made animals and all of that he had at Paradise Park.,,,,,,,
G:	 Um-hm.,,,,,,,
G:	 Would he do the shows there; as well?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 Okay; so he traveled to there and would do it over there?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; he just put that up for people to see; not necessarily he was in everything with that; he had somebody that was running it for him.,,,,,,,
G:	 Oh; okay.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 Do you think it was a big loss to the black community when Paradise Park closed?,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; yeah; yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 I would say so; cause everybody would come; man on a Christmas; they had Santa Claus; and on Easter they would have all that going—It’s a big day at PD Same thing as here.,,,,,,,
F:	 So all of that was missing; yes.,,,,,,,
G:	 Did black people come to Silver Springs as much they went to Paradise Park once it was integrated?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; they just started coming here?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s the purpose of Paradise Park.,,,,,,,
F:	 Now you’re backing up into integration days.,,,,,,,
F:	 And that’s what that was all about back in the days.,,,,,,,
F:	 A lot of people that come here; Blacks I’m talkin’; and they was turned down.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s the purpose of that opened up; the way it was.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s why it become a Paradise Park.,,,,,,,
G:	 Was it something really special for everyone?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 Cause there wasn’t very many places for—that had a separate area?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; but boy man places be-  colored people there.,,,,,,,
"F:	 Man you come at a holiday you couldn’t stir a stick down there, all them people.",,,,,,,
F:	 So it was a drawing card; cause-- bottom line; that’s what it was.,,,,,,,
F:	 I enjoyed it all and I was right in the middle of all of it.,,,,,,,
G:	 You really were; you’ve been in the middle of all of it for a long time.,,,,,,,
F:	 For a long time; that’s right.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; the biggest change is the attendance drop and the switch to it being a state park?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 Well; when it comes to the state park; I’m not saying---being a state park and a theme park; that’s what it was.,,,,,,,
F:	 When I was running it back in those days it was a theme park.,,,,,,,
F:	 And then the state taken over.,,,,,,,
F:	 The reason being; a lot of them-- attendance was droppin with a lot of the places.,,,,,,,
F:	 And the state would just barge in; and pick it out; which I thought was good.,,,,,,,
F:	 Some of the places; they closed down anyway.,,,,,,,
F:	 Things were done a little bit different from what they was doin then.,,,,,,,
F:	 To me; I think it played a good part.,,,,,,,
F:	 I really liked it a whole lot better---when they was doing it—is a theme park in place of a state park.,,,,,,,
F:	 Cause they got the rules and regulations—some good; and some; well; maybe not so good; but--	 That’s the way it was!,,,,,,,
F:	 But I’d just like to keep on taking it the way I done it; as long as I made people happy; but--- A lot of them; they just had to because the attendance had dropped so bad that they couldn’t keep it open; anyway. They just closed it down themselves; and that’s what they done. ,,,,,,,
F:	  That’s the good part; right there; yeah.,,,,,,,
G:	 Was it ever permanently closed?,,,,,,,
G:	 Closed temporarily while they---?,,,,,,,
F:	  Some of em got it temporary but eventually closed completely.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s when the state come in.,,,,,,,
G:	 Okay.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; then; the state comes in and; would re-open it with less operating costs?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah. They were good. ,,,,,,,
F:	 The state got the attendance changed.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; bottom line; I don’t see being too bad because; it’s uh-if they’re gonna keep it open; well then good.,,,,,,,
F:	 If they don’t; then they’re gonna own it anyway!,,,,,,,
F:	 See a lot of them; they just couldn’t maintain them because of the lack of attendance.,,,,,,,
F:	 That’s what they done; back in the day.,,,,,,,
U:	 Can I interrupt for just one second?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yes; you sure can!,,,,,,,
U:	  Whatever it was; when they started constructed of the Barge Canal?,,,,,,,
F:	 Yup.,,,,,,,
U:	 Before that; would you see manatees up in here; then?,,,,,,,
F:	 No.,,,,,,,
F:	 They come up in here.,,,,,,,
F:	 I didn’t seem them; but some did.,,,,,,,
F:	 It’s a strange thing when you see a manatee come out this far.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; yeah.,,,,,,,
U:	 They really can’t get here now; unless somebody opens the locks and one happens to slip through the locks that are at---,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; Rodman was talking about where—Off on Fort McCoy.,,,,,,,
F:	 And I used to fish.,,,,,,,
U:	 Right; me too.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah.,,,,,,,
F:	 Ocklawaha River.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; they got the big locks down.,,,,,,,
F:	 If they close that lock; no; they can’t get through.,,,,,,,
F:	 But; if they open that lock; yes.,,,,,,,
F:	 They come on.,,,,,,,
U:	 Cause they got the dam there now in front of Rodman Reservoir.,,,,,,,
U:	 But; I was just wondering if manatees come up in this far.,,,,,,,
F:	 Yeah; some.,,,,,,,
F:	 Let me explain.,,,,,,,
F:	 I just looked at some not too long ago; right at that big spring; right there!,,,,,,,
F:	 It wanted the Silver River.,,,,,,,
U:	 Yeah!,,,,,,,
U:	 Well; we’ve paddle it all the way from Ray’s Landing.,,,,,,,
U:	 We’ve paddled on our kayaks up and down here many times.,,,,,,,
F:	 I’ll bet ya did.,,,,,,,
F:	  Yeah.,,,,,,,
U:	 Many times.,,,,,,,
U:	 I mean recently.,,,,,,,
U:	 No; I mean; since I’ve been old!,,,,,,,
U:	I didn’t mean to interrupt but wanted to know if manatees had ever---,,,,,,,
G:	 It’s fine!,,,,,,,
F:	 I ain’t got nothing but time; go ahead!,,,1,,,,
F:	 I don’t know how much time she got---,,,,,,,
G:	 I’ve got nothing but time too.,,,,,,,
G:	 So; any other questions.,,,,,,,
