B:,"A time of social unrest, a lot with the new era of thinking in terms of the whole free love scene, and the drug culture, and of course Civil Rights was a very big thing for me, being an African American— and in fact for the country, because it meant a lot of changes, and a great challenge for the country.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Now, what activities —now, that’s America, but what activities were here at University of Florida?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well, at the University of Florida , there were a lot of activities, most of which I felt excluded from ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Give me an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,The sororities.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And just, there were no organizations that I received invitations to join.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But I really wasn’t worried about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And I didn’t seek to join.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I think I was a little bit sensitive , and I felt like , “Okay, you’re going there, you going to get an education, and you’re not going to really worry about pushing the envelope.”",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"You know, just do what you have to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But I must say , it was a very pleasant experience for me.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I came as the daughter of two parents who had not finished high school.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And I was the oldest in my family .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

W:,Relatives in Gainesville?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Yes, and I was happy to be here.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,So.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"You know , even though I felt like things were not exactly open to me, I was not unhappy about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I was a member of a very small group of Black students that were here at the time, and we set about creating a place for ourselves .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And we established the first Black Student Union in my junior year, my first year here.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And that was something that I became very involved in, bringing national Black figures here to speak to the city and students about issues that were coming up.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Do you remember any of them, the names, the—?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Adam Clayton Powell.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And I believe Muhammad Ali.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I believe I remember him coming.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,He was just getting started with the boxing and everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"That was an interesting time for his life, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Yes, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Yes, it was fascinating.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Was he an interesting —?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,He was pretty .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And he was talking to—,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Yeah; full disclosure, he’s one of my favorite people.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Yeah, and at the time, he hadn’t become really known for his defiance of the things that he saw as immoral.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But he was just starting his career .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"He was loud, and he was promoting himself.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But he was still a figure that was saying something , and someone that you wanted to know , “What is this person all about ?”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But I think Adam Clayton Powell was the most prominent person that I remember.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So I think I was more of a warrior on the campus scene in terms of all the things that were happening, the sit -in at Tigert Hall, the takeover of Tigert Hall by the Black students my senior —",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Now, I’ve heard of that.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,—my senior year.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,What was that all about?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well, they felt that Tigert was not responsive to the needs of Black students .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, they were going to sit in until certain demands were made .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I don’t remember exactly what all the demands were, but I believe that establishing Black culture courses —I think that was a part of the demand, to have some Black history, or African—",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,And you didn’t participate in that.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I didn’t participate .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And that was heavy on my mind , because I was not —of course I was sympathetic .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But by the same token, I felt like I couldn’t afford to put myself in a position to be thrown out of school , because so much was riding on me in terms of my family’s expectations.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so it was hard, it was hard for me.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,It was very hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Now that’s, on a social level that’s interesting.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,What about scholastically?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,What was it like to come to University of Florida as either a general or an African American student?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well, before I came, I received a lot of scary stories about how , “Oh, the courses are so hard; you’re not prepared; you’re going to fail ; blah blah blah blah blah blah. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But I had come from a segregated school .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"The whole system from grade one through twelve, I’d been with only Black kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I had gone to junior college, where I was always the only Black student in there, but I had been raised in that segregated situation to think that I was very special.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And that I was the cat’s meow, that I was somebody !",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, I really didn’t feel intimidated by what I was told.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And I said—,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Now, who was telling you this?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Just other Black people, people in general.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I don’t know where they received their information from, but they felt like—well they felt like,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"okay, they felt like my education was inferior because it was separate.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And used to get the old books , and really not a lot of financial support —not as much in terms of materials and all that as the predominantly White schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So therefore, everyone concluded that the education was inferior.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,But this was Black students telling you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,These were mostly  lack people telling me this.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,What about the teachers?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,The teachers always told me I could do whatever I wanted to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But people just in the community felt like, “Oh, okay” —and I think they basically felt that because it was an all -White institution— that when I went in, I would be ostracized, I would be treated negatively, I would fail, I couldn’t measure up.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But I never bought into it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I said, “Well, we’ll see. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so , when I came, I really came with a lot of experimental year where they were given a key .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"They could come in any time they wanted, and they could let themselves in the locked dormitory with their key, but they could not let anyone else in with their key.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So, that’s when they first started to experiment with giving more freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"If you were a junior, you still had to check out, and you used to had to otherwise be in by twelve .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I’m not sure when they stopped that, because I graduated in  69.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And you know, when I came back, I wasn’t in the dormitories.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But I think that was kind of unique, because when my daughter was here in, she came in  91, graduated in 95, the boys could come in; I know there were boys that spent the night.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I can remember going into the restroom , and boy meeting me coming out, and I’m going, “Whoa!”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,A lot of changes between 1969 and 1990.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"A lot of changes, very co-ed, very co-ed!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So that was, like, shocking to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,That was really interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Now, that brings up an interesting topic.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,You left for a few years and came back as a graduate student.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Did you notice any differences, any changes, any evolution at all on campus?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well see, as a graduate student, you’re in a different world.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I was not in touch with people who lived in dormitories, or really in touch with anyone that wasn’t in my department.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, I was married by then, and just living in a different world altogether.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Part time, full time?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I was full time, because I had been a teacher for two years, and I came back that third year ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,deciding that I needed more to teach the students that I had.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Because in English education we’ d been given an approach to teaching that worked very well with bright students, but more and more special needs students were emerging , and I felt like , “Okay, I need something else. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Now, let me back up here: when you said they worked with—did you say “White” or “right? ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I didn’t say “White.”,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Oh, I’m sorry.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"You said, methods that worked some kind of student —",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Oh, special needs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"But before that , they worked for —",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Oh, bright !",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Oh, bright !",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,I’m sorry !,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Bright students.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Bright students.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,My apologies.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"You know, analyzing poems, a lot of analytical kind of thing; and composition through analysis of character themes and that kind of stuff, which you still, it’s still doing in schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But there are different stratas of kids that had needs that were different from that .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I said, “Okay, what can I do to empower myself to gain additional skills to reach these students who are not there, but who are showing up in my class every day ?”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, I got the idea to go back get a degree in Special Education.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, that’s what I received my master’s in.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, I don’t really know what the setting was.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"So you weren’t involved in the Black Student Union, or —",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"No, not at that point.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"It was just, deal with my husband, and deal with my courses , and that was my focus.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,You know?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"Let’s back up a little bit: you were talking about your parents, and they hadn’t even graduated —",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,High school.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,High school.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"So if I could ask you to go back a little bit and talk about your home life or early schooling; so, that’s a huge decision to be the first.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,First family member to go to college.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Right, right.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,In my immediate family.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"However, I had three aunts who were teachers .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, they motivated me—and my mom.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Because my mom was a very smart lady despite the fact that she didn’t finish high school.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Hers was more of—she got married early.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"My dad came back from the war, and she was being raised by her grandparents, and she felt like, “Okay, I need to make some money to take of myself .”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Because it was hard times for the family in general.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And my father came back from the war, and they fell in love, and they got married.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, when he came from the war , he wanted a trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Then, that was the big thing in Black families for the men to get trades , because they —being a brick mason, or a carpenter and all that, paid some pretty good money.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, my father went to Bethune-",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Cookman College Trade School on the GI Bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, he became a brick mason, and later a subcontractor.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So for thirty-eight years, he built houses.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But my mom worked for a prominent White family in town , keeping their house and their children.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And so you know they made a very modest living.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,They built our home.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I was one of four children.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"They really preached education to all of us; however, I was the only one that went to college.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I thought I would be the beginning , but somewhere along the way , the others didn’t take to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I’ve always been highly motivated for education—,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,It sounds like it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I excelled coming through the different grades, and it just seemed like the normal progression for me.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,So.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"So, you mentioned that you were the only Black student in your junior college— classes, is that correct?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Classes.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Class.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,So were the teachers encouraging to go on to—?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"No, the teachers didn’t say anything to me personal .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"It was just, they taught their course .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"They didn’t say anything good or bad, just taught the content.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, my reinforcement pretty much came from my family .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And my teachers through the years always told me I was special, always told me I was smart.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I was an honors student, honor society, I was in the campus leadership, was a part of the band as one of those little flag girl sort of things, kind of a half-majorette, half-flag girl—",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Here at UF?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"No, no, no, that —",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,It’s junior high.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"No, that was in high school.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,So I was involved with a lot things that gave me a lot of self-assurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And so, I think that helped me to come here and just deal with the way things were.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I love this place—I love Florida, I’m a Gator all the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,"So, let me ask this: what led you to come the University of Florida?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,What was your decision-making there?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"At first, I was thinking of going to Dillard in New Orleans, which is a Black school.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Purely because I wanted to go to Mardi Gras.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,You mentioned the partying.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,From the pictures of Mardi Gras.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And my parents didn’t know, I don’t think so.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Why not?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well, they said, “That’s too far away, we don’t have the money to support you in that.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,We can’t bring you home for the holidays.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,It’s too far for us to send for you if there’s an emergency whatever.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,We think it’s better if you go to junior college.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And then, when you go to junior college, then you can go to one of the state schools, and that will be better for you and for us. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So, after really putting up a big fuss, I lost.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,It’s probably just as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well, and you know what?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I’m happy about it, because I just got a really good experience at Florida.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I have no regrets.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,It’s good.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Did you consider any historically -Black colleges in Florida?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"No—well , let’s see.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Well, I’m from Daytona, so there’s Bethune-",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,Cookman there .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,But very few kids want to go school in their home town.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I wanted to get out of town, so .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I don’t know, Florida A&M never interested me, although my friends went to Florida A&M, a lot of them went to Bethune, some of them went to, like, Spelman, and different colleges in Atlanta and Tennessee and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"all those things, but I, you know; no.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I didn’t consider any of them .,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"But once I got, I was settled on the idea of junior college , and I said, “Hey, if I go to junior college,” I figured out, then I can go to UF or FSU as a transfer student.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So I said, “Okay, that’s good.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"I knew that my aunt was over here, so I knew that my aunt was over here.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And I said, “Okay, that’s close to home, so they can’t say anything about , ‘Oh, we can’t get you home,’ because I can catch a ride home. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"And in fact, many times I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,I caught rides with people.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"There was a board in the student union building where they could post , “I’m going such and such, anybody want a ride?”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

B:,"And I met people who were from Daytona I never knew, but I had made their acquaintance .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,And it turned out to be a win-win deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Later on, some of my teachers came over here for a master’s, and I would go home with them —you know, in my senior year.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So , it was good.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
W:,Sounds nice.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"So my daughter, when she was a baby, I always —I brainwashed her into being a Gator .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
B:,"Because all she ever heard—I married someone here locally, but divorced early in her life.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
