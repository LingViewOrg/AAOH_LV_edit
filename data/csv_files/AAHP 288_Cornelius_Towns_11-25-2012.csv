T:,Alachua County Training School.,,,,,,,
T:,"It's up on the -- I can't tell you the name, but it's where the parade come by, where the Hitchcock, that subdivision up there,",,1,,,,,

T:,From one to twelve.,,,,,,,
W:,"And how big was that school, how many students would you say went there?",,,,,,,

T:,It was from -- everything was in there from first to twelve.,,,,,,,
W:,Would you say it was a hundred students?,,,,,,,
W:,Two hundred students?,,,,,,,
W:,Three hundred?,,,,,,,
W:,Less?,,,,,,,
T:,"Maybe about three hundred, mmhm.",,,,,,,
W:,That school doesn't exist anymore.,,,,,,,
W:,"So, when did it close?",,,,,,,

W:,Who was the principal?,,,,,,,
T:,C.O. Whitfield.,,,,,,,
W:,"And, did Principal Whitfield also teach classes?",,,,,,,
T:,"No, he was the -- no , he didn't teach classes.",,,,,,,
T:,"That's all he done, principalship.",,,,,,,
W:,"So when you left Alachua County Training School, then you went to Mebane?",,,,,,,
T:,We all was in the same building; you didn't have to go nowhere.,,1,1,,,,
W:,"Oh, okay.",,,,,,,
W:,"So what was it, the middle school was called the training school?",,,,,,,
T:,"In the same, on the same campus there.",,,,,,,
T:,Right.,,,,,,,
W:,"Okay so who was your favorite teacher in the early part of it, before you got to the high school part of it?",,,,,,,
W:,Who was your favorite teacher and what subjects did you like?,,,,,,,
T:,"I likeded history, which was taught by Maude Lewis.",,,,,,,
T:,"And in fact, she's got her property, it's a park in Alachua named in her honor right across from where the old school used to be.",,,,,,,
T:,She gave her property to the city of Alachua.,,,,,,,
T:,"That was, I learned history from her, mmhm.",,,,,,,
T:,"I always liked history, because it was during the World War II, I likeded to read about the war.",,,,,,,
T:,We didn't have TVs then.,,,,,,,
T:,And my mom took the Times Union so I could read about the war in the Pacific and in Germany.,,,,,,,
T:,That's where my interests come from about the history part.,,,,,,,
W:,"Now, when you got to the high school part of it, did the classes get more difficult, was it more of a social change?",,,,,,,
W:,"What would you say was the difference between the lower school part, eighth grade, and then the upper school part after ninth grade?",,,,,,,
T:,"Really, the change didn't start until I got in tenth grade.",,,,,,,
T:,It's all the same to me.,,,,,,,
T:,"Listening wasn't hard, but the teachers taught different than they do to day, see?",,,,,,,
T:,"The child was a slow learner, they had four classes in the classroom: A, B, C, and D. No child want to be in the D; so she would let the A and B students, she would teach to the two lowest classes, and let the other students do homework in the classroom.",,,,,,,
T:,That's why it should be like that today.,,,,,,,
T:,"They would help the one needed it, that's what to me it was.",,,,,,,
T:,"They would help the one that really needed it, mmhm.",,,,,,,
T:,"And we had a lot of folks, if one was slow, in a couple of years they was right up there with us.",,1,,,,,
W:,"So, do you feel that the schools then had more of a focus on remedial to bring everybody else up, and now a student can flounder on their own?",,,,,,,
T:,"Right, mmhm.",,,,,,,
W:,Why do you think that change happened from the way school used to be then to how it is now?,,,,,,,
T:,"Because I had -- I got six children, and I monitored them going to school.",,,,,,,
T:,"Which, the situation is different.",,,,,,,
W:,Could you list your children from oldest to youngest?,,,,,,,
T:,"Kenneth, my oldest son; Velda, my oldest daughter; Richard, my son; then my son Tim; then my son Michael; and then I got another daughter, Denise.",,,,,,,
W:,And how did you meet their mother?,,,,,,,
T:,I met their mother in Jacksonville.,,,,,,,
T:,"During the time we was travelling, I was going to Chicago to live with my uncle, and I saw her at the train station.",,1,,,,,
T:,That's how we met.,,,,,,,
T:,"And I met her in Jacksonville, and she passed in Jacksonville -- which was this year.",,,,,,,
W:,Oh I'm very sorry for your loss.,,,,,,,
W:,What was your wife's name?,,,,,,,
T:,Odell .,,,,,,,
T:,Her middle name was Wilma.,,,,,,,
T:,"She didn't like that name, we used to call her Odell.",,,,,,,
W:,"So, how long were you all married and had a family together?",,,,,,,
W:,How many years?,,,,,,,
T:,Sixty-two years.,,,,,,,
W:,Can you say that number again?,,,,,,,
T:,Sixty-two.,,,,,,,
W:,"Okay, so, sixty-two years.",,,,,,,
T:,Right.,,,,,,,
W:,"That's a long time, a lot of memories!",,,,,,,
T:,Sixty-two years.,,,,,,,
W:,"Is there a particular memory that maybe is not so private you wouldn't say it in public, but something that you want to say to just to demonstrate your feeling for your wife?",,,,,,,
W:,"For someone maybe listening to this later on that didn't know her, how would you describe your life together?",,,,,,,
T:,I describe my wife was a -- she was a beautiful lady.,,,,,,,
T:,"In fact, the first time I saw her, it wasn't, you know, like love at first sight.",,,,,,,
T:,"Because we only talked, because we was getting on different trains .",,1,,,,,
T:,"And we went across the street, and I bought her a bite to eat.",,,,,,,
T:,"She caught her train, I caught mine.",,,,,,,
T:,"But some kind of way, we got back -- I didn't like Chicago, so I came back to Alachua.",,,,,,,
T:,"So,",,,,,,,
T:,she came back about the same time I did.,,,,,,,
T:,"Then we started dating, in August of 49.",,,,,,,
T:,And that's history right there with her.,,,,,,,
W:,What was it that brought you all together here locally ?,,,,,,,
W:,"Because you can know somebody somewhere else and still see them and not, you know, still see each other.",,,,,,,
W:,"So, what was it that got you all dating in August of 1949?",,,,,,,
T:,"You know, when I saw her she was with her sister, and her sister was from where I had come from on the train.",,,,,,,
T:,And then,,,,,,,
T:,"And she and her sister -- because she said, ""I know you from -- you Ms. Naomi's son!""",1,,,,,,
T:,Just like that.,,,,,,,
T:,"I say, ""Yeah.""",,,,,,,
T:,And that's how I met my baby.,,,,,,,
T:,I always called her my baby; I met her then.,,,,,,,
T:,"I didn't know it then, but it happened.",,,,,,,
T:,"We married in 51, mmhm.",,,,,,,
W:,"So, two years, then you're married.",,,,,,,
W:,Where did you live after you got married?,,,,,,,
T:,We lived in Alachua.,,,,,,,
T:,Then I went in the Army; I stayed in the Army six and half years.,,,,,,,
W:,Now how did you get into the Army?,,,,,,,
W:,"Were you drafted, did you volunteer?",,,,,,,
T:,Drafted.,,,,,,,
W:,Can you talk about that being drafted part?,,,,,,,
T:,Being drafted?,,,,,,,
T:,"Being, usually it's a couple of years.",,,,,,,
T:,"And, at that time, we done twenty-one months.",,,,,,,
T:,"If you went to Korea, you done twenty-one months, you was out.",,1,,,,,
T:,"And onliest thing I can say today: I'm's a veteran, and I'm criticizing the constitutional United States, uh-huh, how the War Department run this, but they should stop sending these men back into combat, in situations that -- Iraq -- ",,1,,,,,
T:,Because I was in a combat unit in Korea.,,,,,,,
T:,And I know what they going through; what I went through.,1,,,,,,
T:,"Hardship, freezing, being shot at, running half of the time.",,,,,,,
T:,"And I see why these guys committing suicide, and something ought to be done about that.",1,,,,,,
W:,"Do you think -- are you saying it's difficult to change from a combat situation to normal civilian life, you need time to adjust?",,,,,,,
T:,Exactly.,,,,,,,
T:,It is.,,,,,,,
W:,What should they do to help veterans that come from those situations adjust?,,,,,,,
T:,"Oh, one time, when President Truman' wife -- which was Bess Truman -- she want us to be, after we left Korea would go to Okinawa and stay there two or three months to adjust to get to come back to the ZI.",,1,,,,,
T:,But that didn't never happen.,,,1,,,,
W:,But that's the kind of idea you would support?,,,,,,,
T:,"That's right, mmhm.",,,,,,,
W:,"So now, you joined the Army -- ",,,,,,,
T:,Drafted.,,,,,,,
W:,"You were drafted, after the Army integrated?",,,,,,,
T:,I was in it when it integrated.,,,,,,,
W:,What was that like?,,,,,,,
W:,Was it still sort of segregated?,,,,,,,
W:,What was it like joining the Army that soon after the integration took place?,,,,,,,
T:,"The Army is still segregated, but it's in a different way.",,,,,,,
T:,It's open.,,,,,,,
T:,"Well at that time, the -- we called it the ""Black GI,"" slept in a different barracks than the White.",,,,,,,
T:,"We ate separate in the mess hall, and the unit that I trained with in Fort Leonard Wood, which was D-battery, which had A and B company -- A, B, C.",,,,,,,
T:,"Abel, Bacon; White: Charlie, Dog; Black.",,,,,,,
T:,They went to Italy in Europe.,,,,,,,
T:,C and D went to Korea.,,,,,,,
T:,That's all I got to say on that.,,,,,,,
W:,"When you were in Korea, were you ever in a situation when you were fearful for your life, and could you describe that?",,,,,,,
T:,Every day you was over there.,,1,,,,,
T:,"See, I was in a combat unit.",,,,,,,
T:,"The unit I served in was the -- you might be familiar with it -- was the Thirty-Seventh Infantry Division, which one of the unit I served in, the Thirty-first, was also in the death march in the Philippine Islands in 41 or 42.",,,,,,,
W:,The famous Bataan Death March?,,,,,,,
T:,"That's right, it's the unit I served in.",,,,,,,
T:,"The Thirty-first Infantry Regiment, known as the Polar Bears.",,,,,,,
T:,That unit carried all that information; they formed a guard and everything.,,,,,,,
T:,"That they was -- they 'd have -- and so when the Korean War broke out, they formed the Seventh, which the Seventh was in World War II.",,1,,,,,
T:,"But they had to reactivate it, so they put different regiments: Seventeenth, Thirty-Second, and Thirty-First.",,,,,,,
W:,What was your job?,,,,,,,
W:,What did you do?,,,,,,,
T:,Machine gun.,,,,,,,
W:,Were you good at it?,,,,,,,
T:,I guess I was!,,,,,,,
T:,That's all I can tell you about that.,,,,,,,
W:,So you knew how to break it down?,,,,,,,
W:,Could you describe the weapon that you used?,,,,,,,
T:,"It's 30-caliber, air-cooled, water-cooled.",,,,,,,
T:,Then you got two sets of machine guns.,,,,,,,
T:,"You got the air-cooled, and the water-cooled.",,,,,,,
T:,"The air-cooled gots a little jackets, like; little holes in it.",,1,,,,,
T:,"But the water-cooled, it takes water to keep the barrel from getting hot and freezing -- you know, melting them.",,,,,,,
W:,"So, you learned how to be efficient with the weapon?",,,,,,,
T:,That's what ,,,,,,,
T:,they trained you for.,,,,,,,
W:,"Was it a one-person operated, or two-person operated?",,,,,,,
T:,"You got the first assistant gunner -- the gunner, the assistant gunner, and four ammo bearers.",,,,,,,
W:,"Okay, so, six men.",,,,,,,
T:,Six men.,,,,,,,
W:,What was the weight of the weapon?,,,,,,,
T:,Maybe about eighty-five pounds.,,,,,,,
W:,"So on the run, you'd have to take it with you?",,,,,,,
T:,Had to take it with you.,,,,,,,
T:,"See, because we had to move -- the gunner would take the gun, and the assistant gunner would take the tripod.",,,,,,,
W:,Who was your commanding officer?,,,,,,,
T:,"My commanding officer was Jim Lements, when I was over the Thirty -seventh.",,,,,,,
W:,And how about your lieutenant?,,,,,,,
T:,"I can remember Lieutenant Knapp, Lieutenant Peterson -- which was a good combat man.",,,,,,,
T:,"And he always trained us to just watch out for yourself, but he was a good leader.",,,,,,,
T:,"I cannot name all the people, because I stayed on almost seven years.",,,,,,,
T:,"I just couldn't tell you, but I remember my combat officers.",,,,,,,
W:,"Now, one person nobody ever forgets is their first instruction drill sergeant.",,,,,,,
W:,Who was that person?,,,,,,,
T:,That would be Sergeant Phillip.,,,,,,,
W:,And why is it that you still remember Sergeant Phillip today ?,,,,,,,
W:,"Because you went right to -- your face, you know him.",,,,,,,
W:,"So, why is it you remember?",,,,,,,
T:,"Sergeant Phillip was in -- he dropped during the Normandy invasion, the 508 Airborne Infantry Regiment, which I was a paratrooper too.",,,,,,,
T:,"And in fact, he was captured in World War II when he come out the plane.",,1,,,,,
T:,"But he was a good leader, mmhm.",,,,,,,
W:,So why do you remember him?,,,,,,,
T:,"He was always, you know, tell us to be on your Ps and Qs.",,,,,,,
T:,Try to do you a favor.,,,,,,,
W:,"So was he one of those cussing drill sergeants, or was he -- ?",,,,,,,
T:,He was a religious man.,,,,,,,
T:,"But I'll say, I didn't have a Black officer; I served only White.",,,,,,,
W:,How did you end your service?,,,,,,,
W:,Honorable discharge?,,,,,,,
W:,How'd you end all that?,,,,,,,
T:,Mmhm.,,,,,,,
W:,"I mean they told you ""this is it,"" you came back to America?",,,,,,,
W:,How'd you rotate out?,,,,,,,
T:,"No, I got out because my wife didn't want to come to Japan.",,,,,,,
T:,"See, I had stayed -- in fact, that's why I reenlist.",,,,,,,
T:,"I reenlist for twenty-four months, but I reenlist after I come back out, couldn't get no job.",,,1,,,,
T:,"And she didn't want to come, so I said -- you know what I mean?",,,,,,,
T:,"I loved her, I had to make a choice.",,,,,,,
T:,It was her or the Army.,,,,,,,
T:,"I see how these dependent, because I'm in a dependent town where, in Jacksonville, where they got this Navy and all that, and how these people have to go leave their families and things.",,,,,,,
W:,"But you know, when you look at history, they talk about how it was the GI Bill, and there was all this housing they built in the 50s.",,,,1,,,
W:,You didn't get advantage of any of those programs when you got out?,,,,,,,
T:,"No, I tried to get a GI loan and build a house; they turned me down, say I wasn't making enough money.",,,,,,,
W:,Even though you were a veteran?,,,,,,,
T:,That's it.,,,,,,,
W:,"Do you think it was the money, or do you think it's because you were not a White soldier?",,,,,,,
T:,Exactly.,,,,,,,
T:,"You know, just be truthful about it.",,,,,,,
W:,And did you hear that same kind of thing happen with other Black soldiers as well?,,,,,,,
T:,"I can't remember but one Black soldier ever building a home; it was Mr. Welch, right there in Alachua.",,,,,,,
T:,That's the onliest one,,,,,,,
T:,I know of.,,,,,,,
W:,I want to go back to high school a second: what clubs and activities were you involved in when you were at Mebane?,,,,,,,
T:,Football and basketball.,,,,,,,
W:,"Ok, what was your favorite?",,,,,,,
T:,Basketball.,,,,,,,
W:,What position did you play?,,,,,,,
W:,You look like a two or a three!,,,,,,,
T:,"Yes I shoot the ball, mmhm.",,,,,,,

T:,I got a son just like me; he can shoot.,,,,,,,
T:,"Mmhm, yes sir.",,,,,,,
W:,Don't like to pass?,,,,,,,
T:,"No, let me knock it down.",,,,,,,
W:,Who was the coach?,,,,,,,
T:,"Mr. Green, English Green.",,,,,,,
W:,English Green.,,,,,,,
T:,Mmhm.,,,,,,,
W:,And what was Mr. Green's coaching philosophies?,,,,,,,
T:,To win !,,,,,,,
W:,Did you all run?,,,,,,,
W:,Did you concentrate on defense?,,,,,,,
T:,Like the fun and gun.,,,,,,,
T:,"You pull it down -- when they shoot and miss, we tried to get to court down in our end as fast as we could.",,,,,,,
T:,That's the philosophy of basketball; ain't no other way.,,,1,,,,
W:,Who were your rivals?,,,,,,,
T:,"Lincoln High in Gainesville, Richardson High in Lake City, and -- in sports in general?",,,,,,,
T:,Central Academy in -- ,,,,,,,
W:,Palatka.,,,,,,,
T:,Palatka.,,,,,,,
T:,Hastings.,,,,,,,
W:,I heard y'all scuffled it up with RJE over in Starke a little bit.,,,,,,,
T:,"I played basketball against them, but that's the only memory I can think of.",,,,,,,
W:,"Now normally, I understand it, when you do this reunion, you usually have a basketball game against RJE.",,,,,,,
W:,But y'all didn't do that this year.,,,,,,,
W:,Do you know why that happened?,,,,,,,
T:,I don't know.,,,,,,,
T:,"Now, I never went to one when I lived near here.",,,,,,,
T:,"But some kind of way, I told my son last week that I wanted to come to one.",,,,,,,
T:,"And I talked to somebody yesterday, he say, ""You know, Mr. Towns, you stayed and you never attended one.""",,,,,,,
T:,"But this one, I just wanted come to.",,,,,,,
W:,So this is your first one?,,,,,,,
T:,"Right, mmhm.",,,,,,,
T:,"Because when I was lived over here I didn't think about it, to be honest with you.",,,,,,,
W:,What was your most successful basketball season?,,,,,,,
T:,We used to have the county tournament.,,,,,,,
T:,"From 48 to 49, we never lost a basketball game.",,,,,,,

W:,"Did you ever play Live Oak, or Perry, or any of them?",,,,,,,
T:,We played Live Oak and Perry in football.,,,,,,,
W:,How did that turn out?,,,,,,,
T:,"In fact, when Live Oak got they team, we used to practice with them.",,,,,,,
T:,That was in 49.,,,,,,,
T:,That's when Live Oak got a football team.,,,,,,,
