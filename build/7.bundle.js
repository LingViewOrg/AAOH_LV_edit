And the other pediatrician, um, I really didn\'t have like no idea of being it, but I had really wanted be \'cause I like to be around teachers. And what are some of the other students in your class want to be? Like? Lawyers and O-B-G-Y-N. Okay. Is that it? For the most part? Yes. Okay. Um, does anyone wanna do anything else? Um, it is a boy in my school he wanna play. He won\'t be in the uh, he won\'t be a basketball player. Okay. What do your teachers, do your teachers know about that? Yes. What do they, what do they do in the class that maybe helps you make your decision? Um, one of my, my reading and writing teacher, he like, for me, I like to write poem. He like, let me read like a poem, gimme a poem book and let me read it.","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1683000,"end_time_ms":1767000,"num_slots":1,"text":"And then, then, uh, he asked me for to write a poem similar to theirs in the book. But like then, then he\'ll read it and he\'ll tell me how, what he think about it. What are your poetry about? Like, I wrote a poem, this song about segregation, separation, um, separation questions about how, uh, my mother and my daddy separated and I wrote a poem about how people should be equal instead of being judged. Okay. So where, where do you get your inspiration from? Um, like what you mean? Like where, so like the civil rights movement that has stuff to do with segregation. So being today 2013, um, how is that relevant to what you\'re writing about? I think it relevant to my mom and my dad because, um, because um, my dad, he really didn\'t want there for me and when I was little and my mother had to take care of me, so this is why I wrote the phone call gra separation of question because I had wanted to know more things about why they separated and why they couldn\'t be together.","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1767000,"end_time_ms":1838000,"num_slots":1,"text":"Okay. So the separation is more about your parents and then the segregation is more about how people judge other people in their, in their ways instead of being like equal to them coming up and being friends to \'em. Okay. So who is being judged? Like, and why? Like, one of my friends, she\'ll be in judged because, uh, because the way she, um, the way she is and the way they like What is she, what do you mean? The way she\'s, um, like she don make she make good grades, but she like, she kinda understand what the teacher is talking about and she don\'t really fully understand like people always calling her dumb and stuff, but she really, she like kinda got a mental problem, but people don\'t see it that way. So do you think today the issue of segregation is more about your ability, how much money you make, things like that instead of race, how it was before? Yes. I think. Um,","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1838000,"end_time_ms":1902000,"num_slots":1,"text":"Um, do you think race is still an issue today? No. No. Why? Because more it seem like more white, white people want to send their kids to my school with some wanna send their kids to a black school to see how it gonna work out to be equal and see if they gonna make friends or not with the um, black, black students. Okay. Um, do you see a lot of white families living here? Yes, but it like got a road. Um, it\'s like white people stay on one side and the black stay on another. Okay. So if they\'re staying on different sides, do you think that\'s segregation? Yes. So there is some racism? Yes. So you would, you rescind your statement before. So you think there is racial segregation still going on? Yes. And some in some part of the community. Okay. Do you kind of wrapping up, do you think some schools maybe the more better schools?","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1902000,"end_time_ms":1970000,"num_slots":1,"text":"Um, do you think it\'s because of race? Um, or do you think it\'s just, just like that? I I really think it\'s not about the race. I think just about how the kids should get their education and how are they getting their education about come to school instead of like, come to school and play a lot. They should like come to school to get their lesson now so they get ready to pass on to next grade and to, they get to college. Why are they playing around? Because they have, they, they think education is not good for them, but they still have to do their work. And some, some kids they like to play before they do their work and then that\'s how they end up back in the same grade or do not be able, won\'t be able to go to college. Why do they think education is not important? Because like one, like they, they see other people in the streets or in their family member, they drop outta school and they think that\'s cool and they gonna drop out too and get, get GED. Do you think the community here places an emphasis on education?","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S2","tier":"Speaker 1","start_time_ms":1970000,"end_time_ms":1978000,"num_slots":1,"text":"Um,","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1978000,"end_time_ms":1982000,"num_slots":1,"text":"I we just, nothing","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1982000,"end_time_ms":1985000,"num_slots":1,"text":"Like your mom\'s friends or anyone that you know, that\'s not your mom, do you, do you feel when you talk to them they say, you know, stay in school it\'s good or are they just like, whatever or They tell me for stay in school so I could be better to be my mom and I can have more highly expectation to, so like I could tell my younger cousin or siblings that they should stay in school and go and don\'t play in school and just drop out and they should always stay in school to go to college.
