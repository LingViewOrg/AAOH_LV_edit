Not only American catch, it\'s a lot of job industries. I\'m not going to just sit here and point out that company. It\'s a lot of companies around here that does that to the employees don\'t really care just as long as they come to work, do what they have to do and go home and get the paycheck right. That\'s it. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And it is not really about that. You know? Uh, like I say, our money isn\'t good money. We as a people have to understand that if we want better, we have to do better. And if it takes us to leave that place or get a union inside of that place, that\'s what we need to do. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. In order to gain something, sometime we must lose. So people just have to really be able to take a stand around here.","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S1","tier":"Speaker 0","start_time_ms":1239000,"end_time_ms":1241000,"num_slots":1,"text":"Right?

I said once, probably about a month ago, I told Rosa, I was like, people are now scared these days. People are not like back in when they first got the union to come here in the eighties, people are not amped up like they were. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And she was like, no, that\'s a lie. People just make excuses. And she was, she made something that made a lot of sense. She said something to me, she was like, we could have, we could go down there and we could rent out a building and we could tell them to come eat with us and drink free with us so we could talk to them. And she said, you wouldn\'t believe it, but probably half of that company inside of there, those people will be there. But if you tell them just to come up here, or if we go out there and stand on the side of the road like we did last year, and you know, with our signs and stuff, we got people talking trash to us and they\'re not going to do that.","dependents":[]},{"speaker":"S2","tier":"Speaker 1","start_time_ms":1317000,"end_time_ms":1370000,"num_slots":1,"text":"But if you give someone, and that\'s sad to say that, but that\'s the way of people and that\'s how people believe.

We\'ll even have y\'all some beer or something back then in the back for, you know, you go back there when you get off work, they\'re gonna come. And it\'s sad to say that about \'em.

They thinking about today, well, today doesn\'t count because you never know what tomorrow\'s going to bring. And people here are just looking at the fact of, I\'m just getting paycheck. Instead of looking at, there could be something better about this job. We can have better benefits. Our kids can, you know, get sick. It\'s, it\'s getting cold. A lot of people here don\'t have insurance. A lot of kids don\'t have insurance. And if you go to the clinic, you will see this people trying to come up with money so that kids could go.

I\'m not gonna say that the union\'s bad, the union\'s not bad. It\'s what we as a people make of the union because we are the people and we are the union. So whatever we decide to make of this union is what is this union\'s gonna stand for us for? Because it\'s our decision what goes down on that black and white paper. On this paper. It\'s our decision. It is us getting up ourself, coming up here listening to what our representative have to tell us what\'s going on now we missing our union meetings and sitting at home on the couch eating fried chicken or whatever.

When we found out about a rebate, you should have seen people. We was like, wow, we get rebates. You know, the recession is good to us. It really is. When you think about it, the poor people, the recession\'s kind of good on us because, um, you have more programs coming in now.

I don\'t care how hard you try, you can go put an application in every week, every week, call these people every week and they will not call you.
