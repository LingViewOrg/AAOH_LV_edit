"P:	 This is Breanne Palmer and Nialah Summers.",,,,,,,
"P:	 It’s September twenty-third and we are at Ruleville Central High School with our friend; Doctor Darron L Edwards and he’s going to just introduce himself and tell us; um; a bit about his life.",,,,,,,
"P:	 So if you just state your name please.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Um; my name is Darron Edwards and I’m a second year principal here at Ruleville Central High School; the school where I graduated from; um; my siblings; my brother; my sister; uh; all graduated from this school; as well as my parents.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So it’s a privilege to be a part of this particular process.",,,,,,,
"S:	 What’s your date of birth?",,,,,,,
"E:	 Ten-sixteen-sixty-eight.",,,,,,,
"S:	 Perfect.",,,,,,,
"S:	 Can you tell us a bit about your family?",,,,,,,
"S:	 You said you had a brother and a sister—",,,,,,,
"E:	 Sure.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I’m the oldest of three children.",,,,,,,
"E:	 My Father’s parents lived in this town and they were very very active in the community.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And my Father—it was four children; two boys and two girls.",,,,1,,,
"E:	 Uh my Father was next to the youngest and he actually uh was the f-; second Black principal of this particular high school.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And he was also the first uh superintendent of this particular school district.",,,,,,,
"S:	 What was his name?",,,,,,,
"E:	 Thomas Edwards Senior.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Um we all participated in sports; here at the high school.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And it’s kind of very interesting because it’s five of us with my Mother; my brother; my sister; my Father; and we all played sports; we all graduated from here.",,,,1,,,
"E:	 And I’m the only one left.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Everybody else moved away.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So; it’s interesting because my Mother; my Father are still here; they’re still leaders in this community.",1*,,,,,,
"E:	 And this is a position that I never dreamed of having; never had a desire or a wish to have; but I feel like it was done because of God’s will.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Because I never ask to have this position; but interestingly enough; I was a college professor.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I did consulting work for all of the public school districts in this area.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So doing consulting work in the area; it just made it even less interesting for me; to want to be a part of public education.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But my father’s the one who’s responsible; because he always encouraged me; he said you would like it if you get into it.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But what happened was; I had certification to be a counselor; and I never pursued it.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So; an administrator’s exam was coming up and I kinda tested my fate and my faith; uh; with God; because I didn’t study or prepare for the exam.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I didn't; and it’s real interesting because my Father encouraged me to take it and it was pretty expensive; so I enrolled and I said that I was gonna take the test and I said well; God I will see if this is for me.",,,,,,,
"E:	 If it’s not for me I’ll stay and continue to work in higher education.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Something that I enjoyed; and I enjoyed the flexibility.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I just didn’t wanna be confined.",,,,,,,
"S:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So the weekend of the test—I had a cousin who had some material about the test; and he gave it to me.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And; uh; I got it and looked over it; didn’t study it; put it to the side.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I said a prayer; I said Lord well; if this is what you want for me to do—I don’t need to prepare.",,,,,,,
"E:	 The knowledge that I possess will be sufficient enough to make a satisfactory score to qualify to be an administrator in public education.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So I went and took the test and it was real easy.",,,,,,,
"E:	 You know; it was just very very easy.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And when I got the results back; they were satisfactory for any school in the United States of America; for me to be an administrator.",,,,,,,
"S:	Wow.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And that’s when I said—I started preparing to transition.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So um that’s how I got into this position; because at the time when I came to work uh in Ruleville on public education; my Father was still the superintendent.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So he retired; after that they had another superintendent who was elected; um and the Mississippi Department of Education abolished that superintendent as well as that school board.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So that’s when the state took over our schools;,,,,,,,
S:	Right.,,,,,,,
E:	 of this county.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So and Ruleville Central High School was one of those schools.",,,,,,,
"E:	 At the time; they were classified as being a failing school; and that’s something that this high school has never experienced before.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Historically; we’ve always been a successful district; and this school has always performed; regionally; pretty well.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So we’ve never experienced low test scores; under-performing uh students; or anything of the sort.",,,,,,,
"S:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So; to have that; it was something that was very uncomfortable; uneasy; and anxiety-filled for this community.",,,,,,,
"S:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E:	 You know to be able—to not to have people that are personable; accessible; and the stakeholders in this community to run the school district.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So it was something new.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So to have the school district being classified as a failing school was something that people were really really interested in making sure that they played a role in changing that; so it could go back to some of the traditions; academically; that existed here.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So being a part of that process; uh it was something that I think a lot of people were nervous about—me coming in.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But uh no one; I think; was more confident in my ability; than my parents.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Uh it w- I can just talk to you—that’s my son—for days and days and days—",,,,,,,
"S:	 Pause it.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Can we do it right qucik—",,,,,,,
"S:	 Mhmm.",,,,,,,
"E:	 We were talking about my motivation and I think; for my parents; to have their oldest child to be a leader in the community that they both grew up in; and one that I grew up in as well; uh was very very meaningful to them.",,,,,,,
"S:	Mm hm.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I don’t think that they could have been more proud of uh me.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Even when I got my PhD; I think this was a lot more meaningful to them.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So uh to me that serves as a sense of uh motivation; but it also serves um for me as a higher order; of making sure that what’s expected of me is fulfilled; not just for myself; but making sure that everything I do; with the decisions I make; the choices I make; and the manner in which I conduct myself is one that would make them proud as well.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So it’s special; and to know that this is the school that my Father worked in; my Mother worked in; and to know that their reputations are one that are still well-respected and well-viewed and perceived in this community.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Also; um kind of increases the standards that you operate by—
S:	Mm hm.,,,,,,,
E:	so it’s good.",,,,,,,
"S:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I mean; I always look at it as a blessing because it could be on the other end of the spectrum.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And you could have leaders who have tainted or tarnished images and then you have to follow those.",,,,,,,
"S:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And you have to play a role at trying to defend them throughout the process.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So it’s a blessing to have parents who are still uh in good physical and mental health; that are still here and still real respected.",,,,,,,
"S:	 Are there still faculty at the school that knew your parents that are still here now?",,,,,,,
"E:	 Interesting uh that you ask because— um my name is Darron Lamont Edwards; and it’s interesting because when I went to school; they all called me by my middle name and no one really knew my first name.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So when I first got the job; there were teachers here who were my teachers when I was in school",,,,,,,
"S:	Oh wow!",,,,,,,
"E:	 ""and when they saw me in the building; they ran up and hugged me.""",,,,,,,
"E:	 They didn’t call me Mister Edwards; they didn’t call me Doctor Edwards; they called me Lamont; and it was like oh Lamont; I’m so glad that you’re here.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And the other teachers who were young; they looked at me like how does she know you?",,,,,,,
"E:	 She calls you by your first name.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So we hugged; and they were very apologetic; you know, and and but that is something that makes you feel good about having this opportunity; because again it's; it could have been another way.",,,,,,,
"E:	 They could have looked at me and said well he’s nobody that we respect; he’s someone that was this type of individual in this community and we know him; not just when he was in school; but even after he finished school.",,,,,,,
"E:	 To know that they respected me then; they respect me now; means a lot.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I get actually the most cooperation; in terms of collaboration; in terms of support; from the teachers who have been here a long time; who have been knowing me all my life.",,,,,,1,
"E:	 And they actually worked for my Father;",,,,,,,
"S:	Wow.",,,,,,,
"E:	so it’s been good.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And a lot of people; you hear; you had a lot of people—and I know this is something that happened with me—you had a lot of people who would say; well I would not want to work in the community where I lived.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Well it depends on the personality and the character of the person; because for me; I’ve actually turned down opportunities to go to other communities to work; for less—I mean for more money.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But you know that’s extrinsic motivation;",,,,,,,
"S:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E	monetary things; so that doesn’t have anything to do with what drives me and motivates me so um you know it.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I love working in the community where I grew up.",,,,,,,
"E:	 The plus side to that is; when the people respect you for your ability to make fair and impartial decisions that are for the best interest of their children; they may not necessarily agree with the decisions; but my decision is always gonna be supported by policy.",,,,,,,
"E:	 As long as I can show it to them and black and white and say this is the rule; and I’m not gonna compromise that; then it’s okay.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I think in the end they end up respecting you even more.",,,,,,,
"E:	 They may not agree with you at the time; but after their emotions kind of settle down and they look at things from an objective standpoint; then they’re okay.",1*,,,,,,
"S:	 And can you tell us how—what was the process to get this school out of failing status?",,,,,,,
"S:	 Now you’re one point away from being a successful school—",,,,,,,
"E:	 Exactly.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Over the last two years; what’s the journey been like?",,,,,,,
"E:	 I will be glad to tell you.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And it’s something that I tell the students.",,,,,,,
"E:	 We’ve been in school—today makes the seventh completed week of school; so what happened a little over a year ago; was that um your performance level—there were various variables that determine your performance level as a school; the drop-out rate; the graduation rate; and in Mississippi; we have um subject area testing.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Okay.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And that’s basically defined by four different areas; Algebra I; Biology I; English II; and US History.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So basically; because of those test results; and students under-performing at a certain level; the Mississippi Department of Education gives you a performance level.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So the performance level of the high school was a failing status.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And uh we had two schools that were classified as failing; and the high school was one of them.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And it was because of several factors; the drop-out rate; well the dropout rate and the graduation rate; and because of a large; significant number of students who did not pass the subject area tests.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So uh what we did was; when we came in at the beginning of the year um—it was my first year as a high school principal; so the learning curve was very very high.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But I took it upon myself to do as much research as I possibly could; and I surrounded myself with some people that I trusted; as well as some people who were knowledgeable about what we needed to do as a team.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So I requested from the conservator.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And the conservator; just so you’ll know; is when the state takes over your school; because of your underperformance.",,,,,,,
"E:	 You don’t have a superintendent; you have a conservator.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So I met with the conservator; and to me; the first step was to bring in a new staff.",,,,,,,
"E:	 There were a large portion of people that we did not renew their contracts; and I brought in a total of eight new staff members.",,,,,,,
"E:	 A new secretary; a new assistant principal; a new counselor; a new lead teacher; some new coaches; a new in school suspension person; uh safety resource officer—people that I was familiar with.",,,,,,,
"E:	 What we try to do at the high school; as it relates to civil rights; and that particular era; we request that our history teachers in the social studies department integrate and emphasize and highlight the Civil Rights Era into their particular lesson plans; into their daily instruction.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And we periodically invite speakers; leaders in our community; as well as leaders from surrounding communities to come in and speak to those students.",,,,,,,
"E:	 One person that you all probably have heard of; may be familiar with; is Mister Charles McLauren.",,,,,,,
"E:	 He’s someone who; last year; came in and spoke; to our student body.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So periodically we do have speakers to come in; like Mister Guyot; who came in today.",,,,,,,
"P:	 How’s that benefitting the students?",,,,,,,
"P:	 Do you feel like it helps instill a sense of pride in them—that they’re learning about people before in Mississippi who were integral in the movement?",,,,,,,
"E:	 I think what it does; is it connects the students with the past; by giving them someone that they just can’t read—and I think you all know; that there are all different types of learners.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So you have learners that learn in different ways and from receiving knowledge and information in different methods; so it’s good to read about it; but it’s also good to have that human component; to come in and actually add that to uh what the teacher is actually lecturing about.",,,,,,,
"E:	 Or what you’re watching on film; or what you’re reading about.",,,,,,,
"E:	 The book can’t answer questions; it can provide you with you know information; but to have a person who can come give you the oral history of what is actually taking place; and they have actually experienced themselves.",,,,,,,
"E:	 It’s a different type of knowledge that’s delivered to you.",,,,1,,,
"E:	 So that makes a difference and I hope that it does serve as a sense of pride and motivation to the students; to let them know about the privileges that they have now; that those people who came before them; the giants or the historians; the heroes; of what they did to give you the opportunity that you have today.",,,,,,,
"E:	 All of that’s important.",,,,,,,
"P:	 What does it mean to you; with your parents having been staples in this community; what is it like for you?",,,,,,,
"P:	 What was it; shortly; growing up in an area like Ruleville; and having your parents be major people in this community? Like what",,,,,,,
"P:	 Does it give you pride; does it—what does it do for you?",,,,,,,
"P:	 What does knowing this history—what has it done for you?",,,,,,,
"E:	 For me—and I like to be modest about it; I just like to look at it; that they had a role to play; in that particular era.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I think God put them in the positions that they were in to help others; and to serve their community.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And what they have done is actually; aside from put pressure on me; to make sure that I fulfill what’s designed for me at this particular moment in my life; to make sure that I try to fulfill as much as I possibly can.",,,,,,,
"E:	 To make sure that in this time uh I open doors for those individuals who will come after me; and make sure that I can take the baton as far as I possibly can; open as many doors as I possibly can; and try to serve as a leader; not just by speaking it; but by living it; and being an example and a model; that my parents; and others who came before me; can be proud of.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But also more importantly; my children; I know how important it was for me to have parents who were respectful; hard-working and dedicated; and always exhibited a form of altruism; where it was always about not doing for yourself; but trying to do something better for mankind; and the welfare of others.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So I know that’s something that’s been instilled in me and it was um—growing up; you didn’t really realize the magnitude of it; until you got to be an adult.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And then you realize that you’re traveling the same path; and you realize what it was like for them. You know; so",,,,,,,
"E:	 It’s been good.",,,,,,,
"P:	 And then finally; just as a last thing; could you tell us about where you did your undergrad studies and your graduate studies and also now you have a doctorate so—",,,,,,,
"E:	 I went to—after graduating um from Ruleville Central High School; I attended school at Mississippi State Valley State University; and that’s the home of Jerry Rice.",,,,,,,
"P:	Yep",,,,,,,
"E:	 I like to say that.",,,,,,,
"E:	 After that I went to Delta State; which is nine miles away.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Right; we were there last night.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And it was a good school; and I like the fact that all of my degrees are from different institutions; but they’re all from the state of Mississippi.",,,,,,,
"P:	Right.",,,,,,,
"E:	 and I’m very proud of that.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So after graduating from Delta State; I received my educational specialist degree from Mississippi State; and",,,,,,,
"S:	Cool.",,,,,,,
"E:	 after that I received my PhD from Mississippi State.",,,,,,,
"P:	Very good.",,,,,,,
"S:	Awesome.",,,,,,,
"E:	 I never had an interest in going to school or attending school; or following my education outside of Mississippi.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I’m fortunate because I have a daughter who is a freshman at Mississippi State.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Ah; wow; well there you go. There you go.",,,,,,,
"P:	  Legacy.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Mhmm. Awesome",,,,,,,
"E:	 Yes.",,,,,,,
"P:	  Is there anything else you’d want us to know; any last; final words to kind of wrap up what you’ve been telling us?",,,,,,,
"E:	 Um, I’m excited to be a part of this process; with you all.",,,,,,,
"E:	 And I hope that at some point; the students who are having an opportunity to experience this—this will serve as some staple in their lives; to help motivate them; that everything is not about how much money you can make; or how many superficial things you can kind of possess.",,,,,,,
"E:	 But there’s a generation of people who came before you; that have opened doors and given you opportunities that you have today.",,,,,,,
"E:	 So I hope that the new generation; of students; the new generation of leaders; are ones who can do just as much and more as I’m doing; and those who came before me.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Perfectly put.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Thank you.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Yes; thank you so much for sharing with us.",,,,,,,
"P:	 We appreciate it.",,,,,,,
"P:	 Alight; we’re turning this of.",,,,,,,
